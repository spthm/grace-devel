GRACE is a GPU-accelerated C++ ray tracing library, designed primarily for traversal of
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) datasets, but configurable with (nearly) arbitrary
user-defined types.
There is currently no documentation, but check the example scripts in the `tests` folder.

To compile your own code which uses GRACE, ensure the `include/grace` folder is in your
include path.

GRACE itself is released under the Mozilla Public Licence v. 2.0 (see LICENCE).
It includes a subset of segmented gpu, which is released under the three-clause BSD licence.
